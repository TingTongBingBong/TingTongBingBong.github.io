          <h2>TingTongBingBong</h2>
          <h3>What is this place?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a webapp I (rmalcolm1) made for our discord server 'TingTongBingBong'
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a website to bring all the tools we use and things we want to do into one place to collaborate!
          </p>
          <h3>What can I do on this site?</h3>
          <p>
            I would suggest exploring the different pages in the top nav-bar to get a sense of what there is and what the site is capable of.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now we can collaborate on research notes on the 'Notes' page and use the calendar on the 'Home' page to plan stuff.
          </p>
          <h3>How did you make this?</h3>
          <p>
            I used the React.js webframe along with Google Firebase for hosting and data storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also a whole lot of ChatGPT and CSS style builders...
          </p>
          <h3>Who has access to this site?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a public site, so whoever has the link can go to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please respect the rules below and don't just share it with everyone, thank you!
          </p>
          <h2>General Rules of Use</h2>
          <h3>1. Respect Everyone</h3>
          <p>
            Treat all members with respect. No harassment, discrimination, or hate speech will be tolerated. Be mindful and considerate in your interactions.

          <p>
            DO NOT SPAM THE EVENT CALENDAR OR NOTES
          </p>
          <p>
            After certain amounts of usage, these things will begin to cost money. There is no way we will hit that amount unless someone is intentionally trying to.
